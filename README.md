# Flight Board Flippers
This application simulates the old airport flight boards. 
* input word or numbers to display on the board
* randomly select name or words from a list/file  in the data panel

## Where's the file?
I like programming in Java :coffee: so you will need JRE or JDK installed to run this application. The runnable :arrow_forward:JAR file is located in the [dist/](dist/) folder.
